## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Submission title
- Code Injection Via .cda file
### Target
- \{url\}/pentaho/plugin/cda/api/previewQuery?path={path}
### Description
- First, I copied the example.cda file at the link below to the test user so as not to affect system data.

- This is unedited data as you can see the data uses Scripting query to create the data table

- "These data sources allow you to create ad hoc result sets, such as a small table, for prototyping purposes using Beanshell scripts. These result sets are useful during the dashboard development phase for generating data for a dashboardâ€™s components when real data is not yet available."
- "Using the Beanshell scripting language, we can define a data structure and then create a result set based on this same structure to use in a component. You will need to define the column names, column types, and the result set rows. "
- The default allowScriptEvaluation status is set to true, but to use the beanshell feature, the system administrator will turn this configuration off.
- The reason is that the system does not filter any dangerous functions or classes before giving it to the Beanshell to execute.
- Therefore I can insert any dangerous Java code into the system to attack remote access.
- Below is PoC.
  
  1, Edit example.cda with dangerous Java code

  2, Click Preview and the code has been executed. Url : {url}/pentaho/plugin/cda/api/previewQuery?path=/home/test/sample.cda

  3, Try with payload "pwd"

### Recommended
- Block dangerous Java classes that execute or use while-list trusted classes or functions.
